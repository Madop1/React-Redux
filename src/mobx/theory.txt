Concepts in mobx
initial stage is to install mobx and mobx-react

CORE CONCEPTS :
--> observer
--> observable
--> actions
--> computed

observable helps us create state in other words state management is done via observable(is an object)..

const state =observable({
    state:0     
})
actions are functions that modify state...actions yield better performance

const state=observable({
    state:0,
    increment: action(() => {
        state.count += 1    
    }),
    decrement : action(() =>{
        state.count -= 1
    })
})

observer : we would need to make every component as observers

const Counter = observer() or export default observer(Counter)

additional method configure which allows only action to modify state

configure({enforceActions:true  })

computed property : if you want to do modification in data before accessing u can use computed property.
